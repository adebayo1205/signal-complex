# signal-complex
# the class C is more complex out of the two classes based on signal2 
# class c is more complex because based on signal 2 it was not distibuted as we can see for class A & B
# i upload the file on python using pandas 
# i use .info() to know what the data Frame is all about.
# using unique to check label classses which A,B&C
# using descible to show the Standard error,means at diffrent level of percentage
# using OLS Regression results to optain the follown
# co-efficient values 
# signal2 co-efficient values, to see the linner relationship with signal1
# to check how signal2 is  significant to signal1
# using seaborn see relationship Signal and Signal2 have together and showing the relationship of classes to signal 1 and signal2
# the 3 classes have well distributed relationship with signal1 but when it get to siginal2 class C is not well distributed and making it more complex to analysied.
