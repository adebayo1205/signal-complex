my frist procedure on achieving this result was to  upload the files on python using pandas.to know whate the data frame is all about,i used a 'info()'.
i also made use of unique to check the class of label A,B,& C.
the standard error and mean at different level of percentage using 'Describe' was done.
then OLS regression was used to obtain the coefficent values of signal2 to see their linear relationship,to check how one signal is significant from the other 'Seaborn' was then used to check the relationship signal1 and signal2 have.
from my observation,the 3 classes have a well distributed relationship with signal1 but on signal2 class C wasn't distributed and thereby making it more complex to be analysed.
conclusion:class C isnt well distributed and complex.
